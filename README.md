# Practicing Git

As an exercise:

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a branch that matches your github name
3. Checkout that branch
4. Update the README to include your name
5. Commit that change
6. Create a new file based on your name (franklin_webber.md) with a small paragraph of text (e.g. song lyrics, poem, movie transcript, book passage)
7. Add that that file to git
8. Commit that change
9. Push the branch back to Github
10. Open a pull-request to merge your branch.
